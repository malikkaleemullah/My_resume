        <li><h3>Python 3 Programming</h3></li>
        <p>This specialization teaches the fundamentals of programming in
            Python 3. We will begin at the beginning, with variables, conditionals,
            and loops, and get to some intermediate material like keyword
            parameters, list comprehensions, lambda expressions, and class
            inheritance. You will have lots of opportunities to practice. You will also
            learn ways to reason about program execution, so that it is no longer
            mysterious and you are able to debug programs when they don’t
            work. By the end of the specialization, you’ll be writing programs that
            query Internet APIs for data and extract useful information from
            them. And you’ll be able to learn to use new modules and APIs on
            your own by reading the documentation. That will give you a great
            launch toward being an independent Python programmer.</p>
